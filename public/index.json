[{"categories":["Cloud"],"contents":"The Question Everyone Asks When you start looking at Microsoft 365 subscriptions, the licensing matrix feels designed to confuse you. Business Premium, E3, E5, add-ons, standalone plans. Microsoft doesn\u0026rsquo;t make this easy, does it?\nFor a small business with 10 to 20 users, the question is straightforward: do you actually need E3 or E5, or is Business Premium enough?\nAfter working with these plans and testing them in real environments, I can give you a direct answer. For most small businesses, Business Premium is not just enough. It\u0026rsquo;s the right choice.\nWhat Business Premium Actually Gives You Business Premium is not a stripped-down version of the enterprise plans. It\u0026rsquo;s a complete package built specifically for small and medium businesses, with a cap at 300 users.\nIn a single license you get the full Microsoft 365 productivity suite including Exchange Online, Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint. You get Intune Plan 1 for device management and app deployment. You get Entra ID Premium P1 which means Conditional Access and proper MFA enforcement. You get Defender for Business for endpoint protection with EDR capabilities. And you get Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 for email security.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not a starter pack. That\u0026rsquo;s a complete security and management platform. The kind of setup that would have required multiple products and significant budget just a few years ago now comes bundled in one SKU.\nIncludes Office apps, email, Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint, etc. Intune Plan 1 basic device management and compliance policies. Entra ID Premium P1 identity and access control (MFA, Conditional Access). Information Protection \u0026amp; Defender for Business endpoint protection and basic threat defense. Focused on SMB security \u0026amp; management with a ~300 users cap. The Security Question This is where people get nervous. They assume Business Premium must have gaps because it costs less than the enterprise plans.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the reality: Business Premium protects against the threats that actually hit small businesses. Phishing attempts get blocked by MFA and Conditional Access. Malware and ransomware get caught by Defender for Business. Unmanaged devices get blocked by Intune compliance policies. Unauthorized access gets stopped before it starts.\nThe tools are designed to work without a dedicated security team watching dashboards all day. You just need to configure them properly, set your policies and they do their job.\nWhat matters more than the license tier is whether you actually use what you have. An E5 subscription with default settings is less secure than a properly configured Business Premium tenant. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it happen.\nAs for subscription comparison, I\u0026rsquo;ve used this great site: https://m365maps.com/matrix.htm#000001000001001000000\nWhere Business Premium Stops Business Premium is optimized for control and baseline security. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t try to be everything.\nYou won\u0026rsquo;t get Intune Plan 2 features like Advanced Analytics or Remote Help. There\u0026rsquo;s no Endpoint Privilege Management for removing local admin rights at scale. No Cloud PKI for certificate automation. No Windows Enterprise features like Autopatch or Quick Machine Recovery. And no Security Copilot for AI-assisted threat hunting.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t accidental omissions. They\u0026rsquo;re enterprise features designed for environments with hundreds or thousands of devices, dedicated IT teams, and complex compliance requirements. At 10 to 20 users, you probably don\u0026rsquo;t need them yet.\nHow E3 Changed Recently Microsoft quietly upgraded what E3 includes. It\u0026rsquo;s no longer just Office plus compliance tools.\nE3 now includes Intune Plan 2 with Remote Help and Advanced Analytics. It includes Windows Enterprise E3 with Autopatch readiness and better recovery options. The gap between Business Premium and E3 has widened on the management and recovery side.\nE3 makes sense when device count grows, when recovery time becomes critical, and when you need deeper visibility into what\u0026rsquo;s happening across your fleet. It\u0026rsquo;s the step up when scale starts to matter.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what catches people off guard: E3 doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically include the security features many assume it has. Defender for Business is actually a Business Premium thing. With E3, you often need additional security add-ons to match what Business Premium includes out of the box.\nWhat E3 includes:\nAll Office apps, email, Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint and enterprise storage. Intune Plan 1 (same basic Intune as Business Premium). Entra ID Premium P1 same foundational identity as Business Premium. Enterprise features such as larger mailboxes, Windows Enterprise rights, and broader compliance controls. When E5 Actually Makes Sense E5 is not about getting more features. It\u0026rsquo;s about reducing risk in environments where risk is already high.\nYou move to E5 when you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with privileged access sprawl across your organization. When you need certificate lifecycle management at scale. When your security team needs AI-assisted investigation tools. When compliance and audit requirements demand advanced retention and forensic capabilities.\nIf those problems don\u0026rsquo;t sound familiar, E5 is probably overkill. It\u0026rsquo;s powerful, but most of that power sits unused in small business environments.\nWhat E5 includes:\nAll E3 capabilities plus multiple advanced security and compliance tools. Entra ID Premium P2 (advanced identity protection and governance). More advanced Defender services, Cloud App Security, and tools like Insider Risk Management. Power BI Pro, Teams Phone system, and expanded analytics. The Practical Decision For a small business starting fresh today, Business Premium makes the most sense. It delivers modern identity security, proper device management, and solid endpoint protection without unnecessary complexity. You can actually manage it without hiring dedicated security staff.\nYou should consider moving to E3 when your user count pushes past the 300 limit, when enterprise recovery features become important, or when you need the analytics capabilities that come with Intune Plan 2.\nYou should consider E5 when security operations become a full-time job, when compliance requirements demand advanced tooling, or when you\u0026rsquo;re actively dealing with the kind of threats that need investigation capabilities beyond what standard tools provide.\nUntil you hit those points, Business Premium is not a compromise. In my opinion, it\u0026rsquo;s the optimized choice.\nWhy I Started Here For this blog, I deliberately chose Business Premium as my testing ground. Not because it was cheaper, but because it reflects what most real environments actually run.\nEnterprise features are impressive on paper, but they don\u0026rsquo;t teach you how Microsoft 365 management actually works day to day. Business Premium does. The skills and patterns you build here transfer directly to larger environments later.\nThink of it this way: Business Premium teaches you how modern Microsoft cloud management works. E3 shows you how it scales. E5 shows you how it\u0026rsquo;s defended when things go seriously wrong.\nThis progression matches how most IT careers actually develop. Start with the fundamentals, build real experience, then move up when the problems demand it.\n","date":"2025-01-08","permalink":"https://halfoncloud.com/posts/m365-business-premium-purchase-introduction/","tags":["MSIntune","M365","Licensing","EntraID"],"title":"Microsoft 365 Business Premium vs E3 vs E5"},{"categories":["Cloud"],"contents":"Choosing the Right Plan Microsoft offers three main business tiers: Basic, Standard, and Premium. For this blog and my testing environment, I went with \u0026ldquo;Business Premium\u0026rdquo; because it\u0026rsquo;s the only one that includes Intune and Entra ID P1. If you need device management and Conditional Access, the other two won\u0026rsquo;t cut it.\nThe pricing shows $22/user/month for annual billing. I started with monthly to test things out first.\nReal World Pricing in Europe Microsoft publishes prices in USD, but if you\u0026rsquo;re in Europe you pay in local currency plus VAT, the difference is significant.\nI\u0026rsquo;m based in Romania, so here\u0026rsquo;s what the actual costs look like in my region:\nBusiness Premium runs about 29 EUR per user per month with VAT included. That\u0026rsquo;s what I pay for this blog\u0026rsquo;s test tenant. It aligns with typical EU pricing where VAT gets added on top of the base rate.\nE3 is listed at €37.70 per user per month before VAT on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Romanian pricing page. Once VAT is applied, you\u0026rsquo;re looking at roughly 45 to 50 EUR per month per user. That\u0026rsquo;s about 1.5 times what Business Premium costs.\nE5 is listed at €59.70 per user per month before VAT. With VAT included, expect around 70 to 75 EUR per user per month. That\u0026rsquo;s roughly 2.5 times the Business Premium price.\nFrom a pure cost perspective: Business Premium at around 29 EUR is competitive and practical for small teams. E3 at 45 to 50 EUR is a meaningful jump that only makes sense if you genuinely need the enterprise management and recovery features. E5 at 70 to 75 EUR is a significant investment that\u0026rsquo;s typically only practical when advanced security automation or compliance tools become necessary.\nA note about \u0026ldquo;Microsoft Teams\u0026rdquo; in the EU: Microsoft previously sold Enterprise plans (E3/E5) without Teams in the EEA due to competition regulations. As of November 2025, customers worldwide can again purchase suites with Teams included. Business plans like Business Premium were not affected and have always included Teams. If you\u0026rsquo;re buying Enterprise plans without Teams, expect to pay about €8 less per user, with Teams available as a separate standalone.\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/09/12/evolving-our-productivity-offerings-to-resolve-european-competition-concerns-about-teams/\nStarting the Purchase After clicking \u0026ldquo;Buy now\u0026rdquo; on Business Premium, you land on the subscription setup page. Here you pick how many users, subscription length, and billing frequency.\nI chose 1 user and monthly billing. Yes, monthly costs more per month, but I wanted flexibility while setting everything up. You can always switch to annual later once you\u0026rsquo;re committed.\nCreating Your Admin Account This is where you create your first Global Administrator account. The username you pick here will be your primary admin login, and the domain defaults to yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com.\nIn my case: RaduBogdan@HalfOnCloud.onmicrosoft.com\nStore these credentials somewhere safe. This is your \u0026ldquo;break glass\u0026rdquo; account for when things go wrong. Password manager, secure notes, whatever you use. Just don\u0026rsquo;t lose it.\nPayment Details Standard payment form. Credit card, billing address, the usual. Microsoft accepts Visa, Mastercard, and Amex.\nNote that it says \u0026ldquo;You won\u0026rsquo;t be charged until you buy something\u0026rdquo; which confused me at first. They mean the trial period if you selected one, otherwise you get charged immediately after completing the order.\nOrder Review Final confirmation before purchase. Check the price, quantity, payment method, and billing address. The total here showed €29.91 including tax for monthly billing in my region.\nThe fine print mentions you can cancel within 7 days for a prorated refund. After that, no refunds. Also worth noting: Global, Billing, and Reader admin roles will automatically get access to the billing account.\nOrder Confirmed Done. Order is placed and Microsoft immediately asks you to set up MFA. This is not optional anymore, Microsoft enforces it for all new admin accounts.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Action required\u0026rdquo; box tells you to set up Microsoft Authenticator. You can use other authenticator apps, but Microsoft pushes their own.\nSetting Up MFA Microsoft walks you through the Authenticator setup. Download the app if you don\u0026rsquo;t have it, then follow the prompts.\nThe process is straightforward: open the app, add a work account, scan the QR code (not shown here), and approve the test notification.\nMFA Complete Once the authenticator is linked, you\u0026rsquo;re done with the initial security setup. This becomes your default sign-in method going forward.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next At this point you have an active M365 Business Premium subscription and a secured admin account. The next steps would be accessing the admin center, adding a custom domain, and starting to configure the tenant.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll cover those in the next post.\n","date":"2025-01-08","permalink":"https://halfoncloud.com/posts/m365-business-premium-purchase-part-1/","tags":["MSIntune","M365","Licensing"],"title":"Purchasing Microsoft 365 Business Premium subscription"},{"categories":["General"],"contents":"Who I Am I\u0026rsquo;m Radu, an IT professional working mostly with Microsoft technologies. My days are spent somewhere between on-prem infrastructure and cloud services, which is exactly where the name \u0026ldquo;HalfOnCloud\u0026rdquo; comes from. Not fully in the cloud, not stuck in the past but somewhere in between, like most real environments.\nMy main areas are Microsoft SCCM/ConfigMgr, Intune, Azure, Entra ID and Microsoft 365. I also work with VMware for virtualization and PowerShell for pretty much everything else. If it can be automated I\u0026rsquo;ll definetely try to.\nWhat This Blog Is This isn\u0026rsquo;t a polished knowledge base or a collection of perfect tutorials. It\u0026rsquo;s more like my technical journal, a place where I document what I learn, what breaks and what actually works in production.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll find step-by-step guides based on things I\u0026rsquo;ve actually implemented, PowerShell scripts I use in real environments, troubleshooting notes from problems that took way too long to solve and occasional opinions on tools and approaches that I\u0026rsquo;ve tested myself.\nSome posts will be detailed walkthroughs, others might be short notes so I don\u0026rsquo;t forget how I fixed something. My goal here is practical and reproducible, not theoretical.\nWhy I Started Writing Honestly? Because I kept solving the same problems twice. I\u0026rsquo;d fix something, move on, then six months later face the same issue and have to figure it out again. Writing it down forces me to understand it properly and gives me something to reference later.\nIf other people find it useful, that\u0026rsquo;s a bonus. But this blog exists first for future me, and second for anyone else working with these technologies who might be stuck on the same problems.\nThe Journey I don\u0026rsquo;t have all the answers. I\u0026rsquo;m learning as I go, just like everyone else in IT. Some of what I write today might be outdated or improved tomorrow which is totally fine. This blog is a snapshot of where I am in my technical journey, not a claim to expertise.\nIf you spot something wrong or know a better way, I\u0026rsquo;d genuinely like to hear it. The best solutions usually come from the community, not from one person figuring everything out alone.\nThank you for stopping by.\n","date":"2025-01-07","permalink":"https://halfoncloud.com/posts/welcome-to-halfoncloud/","tags":["About"],"title":"Welcome to HalfOnCloud"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Radu IT professional specializing in Microsoft technologies: SCCM, Intune, Azure, EntraID, and M365.
