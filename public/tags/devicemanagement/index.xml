&lt;p&gt;This article walks through an Intune environment built in a small lab tenant. The focus is on the foundation that needs to be in place before Windows Autopilot can work reliably: tenant readiness, enrollment controls, device targeting, ESP behavior and a security baseline that holds up under real use. Everything shown reflects actual configuration, including what is enabled and how the pieces connect together.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The environment is Windows-only and centered on User Driven Autopilot with Microsoft Entra join. The screenshots walk through tenant health, service connectors, dynamic device groups and Enrollment Status Page behavior along with a few optimizations.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
