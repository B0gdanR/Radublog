&lt;p&gt;Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve came across someone in the LinkedIn MEM community asking for a solution regarding a website URL that needed to be pinned to the Windows taskbar through Microsoft Intune with a custom icon, so clicking on it would simply open a browser page (Edge) automatically loading a specific URL. They had already tried the obvious approach by deploying the shortcut as a Win32 app and reference it in a Taskbar Layout XML policy but without too much success.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In this article I&amp;rsquo;ll share one possible solution along with the reasoning behind each step, so you can also follow the logic and build on it in your own environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>M365 Business Premium Part 8: Anatomy of a Failed Enrollment - Tracing an ESP Error from Screen to Root Cause</title><link>https://halfoncloud.com/posts/m365-business-premium-part-8-anatomy-of-a-failed-enrollment-tracing-an-esp-error-from-screen-to-root-cause/</link><pubDate>Thu, 12 Feb 2026 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://halfoncloud.com/posts/m365-business-premium-part-8-anatomy-of-a-failed-enrollment-tracing-an-esp-error-from-screen-to-root-cause/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="when-the-enrollment-status-page-fails"&gt;When the Enrollment Status Page Fails&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This article picks up where &lt;a href="https://halfoncloud.com/posts/m365-business-premium-part-7-intune-autopilot/"&gt;Part 7&lt;/a&gt; left off. If you followed that walkthrough, you have a working Autopilot deployment that registers devices, joins them to Entra ID and delivers apps through the Enrollment Status Page. This part covers what to do when that process breaks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Enrollment Status Page is the gatekeeper of Windows Autopilot. It tracks device preparation, device setup and account setup in sequence, holding the user at a progress screen until every assigned policy and application has been applied. When everything works, the user sees green checkmarks, login and lands on a configured desktop but when something fails, the ESP displays an error code and stops.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
