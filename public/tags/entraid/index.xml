&lt;p&gt;Users should have MFA configured before they enroll devices, &lt;strong&gt;Conditional Access&lt;/strong&gt; policies need to be in place before onboarding begins too.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Get this right and you have minor interruptions during onboarding, get it wrong and you&amp;rsquo;ll be fielding angry phone calls. This matches what I experienced in the past, having CA policies and authentication methods configured before Autopilot enrollment made the process smooth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-real-threat-landscape"&gt;The Real Threat Landscape&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Microsoft blocks an average of ~7,000 password attacks per second, Cyberattacks strike at an unprecedented scale, with Microsoft recording approximately ~600 million blocked threat attempts every 24 hours. This volume represents an increase in hostile actions, creating a threat environment where malicious packets slam into networks nearly every second.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Microsoft 365 Business Premium vs E3 vs E5</title><link>https://halfoncloud.com/posts/m365-business-premium-purchase-introduction/</link><pubDate>Tue, 07 Jan 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://halfoncloud.com/posts/m365-business-premium-purchase-introduction/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="the-question-everyone-asks"&gt;The Question Everyone Asks&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you start looking at Microsoft 365 subscriptions, the licensing matrix feels designed to confuse you. Business Premium, E3, E5, add-ons, standalone plans. Microsoft doesn&amp;rsquo;t make this easy, does it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a small business with 10 to 20 users, the question is straightforward: do you actually need E3 or E5, or is Business Premium enough?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After working with these plans and testing them in real environments, I can give you a direct answer. For most small businesses, Business Premium is not just enough. It&amp;rsquo;s the right choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="what-business-premium-actually-gives-you"&gt;What Business Premium Actually Gives You&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Business Premium is not a stripped-down version of the enterprise plans. It&amp;rsquo;s a complete package built specifically for small and medium businesses, with a cap at 300 users.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
