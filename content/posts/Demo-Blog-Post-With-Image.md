# Claude Desktop Integration Demo

This is a demonstration of how Claude can help you create blog posts with images for your Hugo static site.

## Setup Overview

Here's what the Claude Desktop interface looks like with all the integrations enabled:

As you can see in the screenshot above, the following MCP servers are configured and running:
- **Intune** - For Microsoft Intune management
- **mcp-obsidian** - For Obsidian vault integration (enabled)
- **SCCM** - For SCCM administration

## Benefits

With this setup, Claude can:
1. Read and write to your Obsidian vault
2. Search through your notes
3. Create blog posts with proper formatting
4. Reference images that you provide

## Next Steps

Simply copy the referenced images to your Obsidian vault's `Personal/Images/` folder, and you're ready to publish!
