## Who I Am

I work in IT, mainly around Microsoft environments. Most of my day-to-day work involves building, fixing, and securing systems based on:

- Microsoft SCCM, Intune, Azure, Entra ID, and Microsoft 365
- VMware virtualization
- PowerShell for automation and troubleshooting

I care more about what actually works in production than what looks good on slides.

## What You Will Find Here

This blog is a collection of solutions and notes taken from real issues I've had to solve:

- Step-by-step guides based on actual implementations
- PowerShell scripts I use in real environments
- Troubleshooting notes and lessons learned
- Observations from working with Microsoft infrastructure at scale

The goal is to keep things practical, direct, and reproducible.

## Why This Blog Exists

I started writing things down because I kept solving the same problems more than once. If something took time to research, test, or fix, it's worth documenting.

This site is mainly for people who work with these technologies every day, including future me.
