## Who I Am

I'm Radu, an IT professional working mostly with Microsoft technologies. My days are spent somewhere between on-prem infrastructure and cloud services, which is exactly where the name "HalfOnCloud" comes from. Not fully in the cloud, not stuck in the past but somewhere in between, like most real environments.

My main areas are Microsoft SCCM/ConfigMgr, Intune, Azure, Entra ID and Microsoft 365. I also work with VMware for virtualization and PowerShell for pretty much everything else. If it can be automated I'll definetely try to.

## What This Blog Is

This isn't a polished knowledge base or a collection of perfect tutorials. It's more like my technical journal, a place where I document what I learn, what breaks and what actually works in production.

You'll find step-by-step guides based on things I've actually implemented, PowerShell scripts I use in real environments, troubleshooting notes from problems that took way too long to solve and occasional opinions on tools and approaches that I've tested myself.

Some posts will be detailed walkthroughs, others might be short notes so I don't forget how I fixed something. My goal here is practical and reproducible, not theoretical.

## Why I Started Writing

Honestly? Because I kept solving the same problems twice. I'd fix something, move on, then six months later face the same issue and have to figure it out again. Writing it down forces me to understand it properly and gives me something to reference later.

If other people find it useful, that's a bonus. But this blog exists first for future me, and second for anyone else working with these technologies who might be stuck on the same problems.

## The Journey

I don't have all the answers. I'm learning as I go, just like everyone else in IT. Some of what I write today might be outdated or improved tomorrow which is totally fine. This blog is a snapshot of where I am in my technical journey, not a claim to expertise.

If you spot something wrong or know a better way, I'd genuinely like to hear it. The best solutions usually come from the community, not from one person figuring everything out alone.

Thank you for stopping by.
