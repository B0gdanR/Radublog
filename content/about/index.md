About Me
Welcome! My name is Radu Bogdan from Bucharest, Romania and I'm the author of HalfOnCloud.com, a blog about Modern Workplace technologies.
Over 17 years of experience in the IT industry, currently working as a System Engineer mainly focused on Microsoft technologies (Configuration Manager, Active Directory, Intune, EntraID, AzureAD, M365) and VMware virtualization.
I've started this blog to store my notes on various solutions, procedures and fixes.
