# About Me

Welcome! My name is **Radu Bogdan** from Bucharest, Romania and I'm the author of **HalfOnCloud.com**, a blog about **Modern Workplace** technologies.

**Over 17 years of experience** in the IT industry, currently working as a **System Engineer** mainly focused on Microsoft technologies (Configuration Manager, Active Directory, Intune, EntraID, AzureAD, M365) and VMware virtualization.

I've started this blog to store my notes on various **solutions, procedures and fixes**.
