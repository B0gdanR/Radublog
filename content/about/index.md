## Hi, I'm Radu Bogdan

I'm an IT infrastructure specialist based in Bucharest, Romania, with over 17+ years of hands-on experience across Microsoft environments. I currently work with both servers and endpoints and identity at scale, managing environments of 10,000+ devices.

## What I Work With

My core stack is Microsoft SCCM/MECM, Intune, Azure, Entra ID and Microsoft 365. I also work with VMware for virtualization and PowerShell for automation across all of it.

I have designed and architected full Microsoft Intune environments, as well as SCCM infrastructures.

In production environments, I have built Autopilot deployments from the ground up, led migrations from SCCM to Intune, strengthened Entra ID security configurations and developed PowerShell automation executed across thousands of endpoints. The content published on this blog is based directly on that hands-on experience.

## What You'll Find Here

Step-by-step technical guides based on real implementations, not documentation rewrites. When I write about an ESP failure during Autopilot, it's because I traced it through registry keys and event logs on a live deployment. When I cover Conditional Access policies, it's the configuration I actually shipped to production.

I focus on what works, what breaks and why. If I hit a gotcha that cost me hours, I document it so it doesn't cost you the same.
