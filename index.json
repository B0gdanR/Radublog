[{"categories":["Cloud"],"contents":"Security Before Enrollment Users should have MFA configured before they enroll devices, Conditional Access policies need to be in place before onboarding begins too.\nGet this right and you have minor interruptions during onboarding, get it wrong and you\u0026rsquo;ll be fielding angry phone calls. This matches what I experienced in the past, having CA policies and authentication methods configured before Autopilot enrollment made the process smooth.\nThe Real Threat Landscape Microsoft blocks an average of ~7,000 password attacks per second, Cyberattacks strike at an unprecedented scale, with Microsoft recording approximately ~600 million blocked threat attempts every 24 hours. This volume represents an increase in hostile actions, creating a threat environment where malicious packets slam into networks nearly every second.\nSource: \u0026ldquo;Microsoft Digital Defense Report 2025\u0026rdquo; https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/corporate-responsibility/dmc/en-us/corporate-responsibility/cybersecurity/microsoft-digital-defense-report-2025/\n80-90% of successful ransomware compromises originate through unmanaged devices. This is exactly why device compliance and Conditional Access matter, blocking unmanaged devices cuts off a major attack vector.\nThe good news: most successful cyberattacks could be stopped with basic security hygiene.\nThe 99% Rule Basic security hygiene still protects against 99% of attacks. The five fundamentals are:\nEnable MFA Apply Zero Trust principles Use XDR and antimalware Keep systems up to date Protect data What Are You Protecting? Focus on what matters to the organization: sensitive information, device security, encryption and malware protection.\nFew years ago I stumble across this quote worth remembering: \u0026ldquo;Try not to make it a dictatorship\u0026rdquo;!\nSecurity that\u0026rsquo;s too restrictive gets bypassed, the goal is protection without killing productivity.\nEntra Admin Center Overview The Entra admin center gives you a quick snapshot of your tenant. Here you can see my tenant HalfOnCloud with the primary domain devworkplace.cloud and a Entra ID P1 licensing.\nTenant Properties The Properties tab shows the tenant configuration, data is stored in EU Model Clause compliant datacenters, which matters for GDPR.\nNote: Security Defaults is blocked because Conditional Access policies are already in use in my tenant, so that\u0026rsquo;s an expected behavior.\nIdentity Secure Score The Recommendations tab shows the Identity Secure Score at the moment 50.76% which refreshes every ~24 hours.\nProbably you\u0026rsquo;ll see a couple of recommendations broken down by priority, the high-priority items include MFA for admins, blocking legacy authentication and ensuring all users can complete MFA:\nIdentity Secure Score - Status View This expanded view shows which recommendations are completed and when.\nSeveral items show \u0026ldquo;Completed\u0026rdquo; status: consent controls, multiple global admins, password expiration settings and least privileged roles.\nIdentity Secure Score - P2 Requirements Scrolling down reveals items that require higher licensing. \u0026ldquo;Protect all users with a sign-in risk policy\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Protect all users with a user risk policy\u0026rdquo; both need Entra ID P2, same with Defender for Identity deployment.\nNote: These will be address in the future with the addition of the E5 Security add-on activation.\nNamed Locations Named locations help reduce false positives in security reports and enable location-based Conditional Access policies.\nIn my tenant I\u0026rsquo;ve configured RO-Home-HalfOnCloud as a trusted IP ranges location using my own IP public address, which in this example it\u0026rsquo;s linked to one of my existing Conditional Access policies \u0026ldquo;CA-003-Require-MFA-All-Users\u0026rdquo;:\nNamed Location Details Opening the location shows the configuration, the name follows my naming convention (Country-Context-Tenant).\nNote: The \u0026ldquo;Naming Convention\u0026rdquo; section will be addressed in a future article.\n\u0026ldquo;Mark as trusted location\u0026rdquo; is enabled with my home IP range configured, only mark locations as trusted if you genuinely control that network:\nAuthentication Methods The Authentication methods Policies blade shows all available methods:\nIn my tenant, at least for the time being, only Microsoft Authenticator, SMS, Temporary Access Pass, Software OATH tokens, Voice call and Email OTP are enabled for all users.\nPasskey (FIDO2), Hardware OATH tokens, Certificate-based authentication and QR code are disabled.\nNote: In a hardened environment, you\u0026rsquo;d disable SMS and Voice call since they\u0026rsquo;re phishable methods, exploit human psychology through deception (social engineering) via email, phone (vishing), SMS (smishing) or fake websites.\nMicrosoft Authenticator - Enable and Target The Microsoft Authenticator settings show Enable and Target configuration.\nIt\u0026rsquo;s enabled for All users with Optional registration, authentication mode is set to \u0026ldquo;Any\u0026rdquo; which allows both push notifications and passwordless sign-in:\nMicrosoft Authenticator - Configure The Configure tab has the important security features.\n\u0026ldquo;Require number matching for push notifications\u0026rdquo; is Enabled, this prevents MFA fatigue attacks by requiring users to type a number shown on screen.\n\u0026ldquo;Show application name\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;Show geographic location\u0026rdquo; in notifications help users identify suspicious sign-in attempts:\nTemporary Access Pass Temporary Access Pass (TAP) is enabled for All users with Optional registration.\nTAP is a time-limited passcode for bootstrapping new accounts or account recovery. It\u0026rsquo;s essential for Autopilot scenarios where users need to complete Windows Hello setup before they have any other MFA method registered.\nNote: Only administrators can issue TAP codes.\nTemporary Access Pass - Configure The Configure tab shows the TAP settings I\u0026rsquo;m using. Minimum lifetime is 1 hour, maximum is 23 hours, and default is 8 hours.\nThe important setting here is \u0026ldquo;One-time\u0026rdquo; set to No. One-time TAP codes break Intune enrollment because the code expires after first use and Autopilot needs multiple authentications during setup:\nTemporary Access Pass - Edit Settings This is how the edit panel for TAP configuration looks, you can set lifetime in Minutes, Hours or Days.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve configured 1 hour minimum, 23 hours maximum and 8 hours default, Length is 8 characters. \u0026ldquo;Require one-time use\u0026rdquo; is set to No for the Autopilot compatibility reason mentioned above:\nPassword Protection Password protection helps prevent weak and predictable passwords, Smart lockout is configured with 10 failed attempts before lockout and 60 seconds lockout duration.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve enabled a custom banned password list with organization-specific terms, for example: halfoncloud, devworkplace, intune, bucharest, romania, Password, Welcome etc.. These are words attackers would likely try first.\nNote: Password protection for Windows Server Active Directory is disabled since this is a cloud-only environment.\nAuthentication Strengths Authentication strengths let you define which MFA methods are acceptable for different scenarios. You can use built-in strengths or create custom ones.\nI have one custom strength called \u0026ldquo;SecInfo-Registration-Secure\u0026rdquo;, plus the three built-in options: Multifactor authentication, Passwordless MFA and Phishing-resistant MFA.:\nCustom Authentication Strength This shows my custom \u0026ldquo;SecInfo-Registration-Secure\u0026rdquo; authentication strength. It solves the chicken-and-egg problem where users need MFA to register their MFA methods.\nThe allowed methods are Windows Hello for Business, Passkeys (FIDO2), Certificate-based Authentication, and Temporary Access Pass (both one-time and multi-use). This lets new users authenticate with a TAP code to set up their permanent MFA method.\nNote: The Phishing-resistant custom MFA is linked to a Microsoft-managed policy, which will be addressed in another article.\nPassword Reset - Properties Self-service password reset is enabled for All users.\nThe blue banner is important: \u0026ldquo;Admins are always enabled for SSPR and require two authentication methods to reset their password\u0026rdquo;.\nThis page links to Authentication methods, Registration, Notifications and other SSPR settings:\nPassword Reset - Authentication Methods Users need 1 method to reset their password, also Security questions are available as an option.\nFor my tenant I\u0026rsquo;ve configured 5 questions required to register and 4 questions required to reset. The banner reminds us that admins always need 2 methods regardless of this setting:\nPassword Reset - Registration Users are required to register when signing in, this ensures everyone has SSPR methods configured before they actually need them.\nRe-confirmation is set to 180 days, so users verify their authentication info every 6 months.\nPassword Reset - Notifications Both notification options are enabled. Users get notified when their password is reset and all admins get notified when any admin resets their password.\nThe admin notification is a security feature, it helps detect if someone has compromised an admin account and is resetting passwords:\nPassword Reset - Administrator Policy This read-only page shows the administrator-specific SSPR policy. Admins always have SSPR enabled and always require 2 methods to reset.\nAvailable methods for admins include Email, Mobile phone (SMS), Mobile phone (voice), Office phone, Mobile app code and Mobile app notification.\nNote: Security questions are not available for admins as they\u0026rsquo;re weak authentication, admins typically use stronger methods.\nUser Settings User settings control what regular users can do in the tenant, hence I\u0026rsquo;ve disabled several self-service options.\nUsers cannot register applications or create security groups, Non-admin users are restricted from creating tenants, Guest user access is set to the most restrictive option, Access to the Entra admin center is restricted and LinkedIn account connections are disabled:\nExternal Collaboration Settings This page controls guest user behavior. Guest user access restrictions are set to the most restrictive option, guests can only see their own directory objects.\nFor guest invites, only users with specific admin roles can invite guests. Self-service sign up via user flows is disabled, External users can remove themselves from the organization. Collaboration restrictions allow invitations to any domain for now:\nGroups - General Settings Group settings control self-service group management, Owners can manage group membership requests in My Groups.\nUsers cannot create security groups or Microsoft 365 groups via Azure portals, API, or PowerShell.\nNote: This prevents shadow IT and keeps group management centralized with admins.\nEnterprise Applications The Enterprise applications blade shows applications using your tenant as an identity provider, currently in my tenant there\u0026rsquo;s only one: \u0026ldquo;Microsoft Graph Command Line Tools\u0026rdquo;\nNote: This was created on November 26, 2025 when I\u0026rsquo;ve first connected with the Microsoft Graph PowerShell module. As you add more integrations and consent to apps, they\u0026rsquo;ll appear here.\nUser Consent Settings User consent for applications is set to \u0026ldquo;Do not allow user consent\u0026rdquo;, this means an administrator must approve all apps that request access to organizational data.\nNote: This is more restrictive than the recommended \u0026ldquo;Allow user consent for apps from verified publishers\u0026rdquo; but prevents users from accidentally granting permissions to malicious apps:\nAdmin Consent Settings The admin consent workflow is enabled. When users try to access an app they can\u0026rsquo;t consent to, they can request admin approval.\nOne user is configured as a reviewer, Email notifications and expiration reminders are enabled.\nNote: Consent requests expire after 30 days if not acted upon.\nAdmin Consent Request Reviewers This shows the reviewer selection for admin consent requests, here I\u0026rsquo;ve selected my own user as the reviewer.\nNote: Only users with Global Administrator, Application Administrator or Cloud Application Administrator roles can actually grant admin consent. Other reviewers can review, block or deny requests:\nAdmin Consent Requests Queue This is where pending consent requests appear, currently there are no pending requests.\nWhen users request access to apps they can\u0026rsquo;t consent to themselves, the requests show up here. Reviewers can approve (grant consent), block (disable the app) or deny (ignore the request) from this queue:\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next In the next part, I\u0026rsquo;ll cover Conditional Access policies in detail, the actual policies I\u0026rsquo;ve implemented, how they work together and the lessons learned from testing them.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll also walk through the Microsoft Intune prerequisites you need before enrolling your first device.\n","date":"2025-01-10","permalink":"https://halfoncloud.com/posts/m365-business-premium-part-3-entraid-security-best-practices/","tags":["MSIntune","M365","EntraID","Security"],"title":"M365 Business Premium Part 3: Entra ID Security Best Practices"},{"categories":["Cloud"],"contents":"First Look at the Tenant After completing the purchase and the initial MFA setup, you land in the Microsoft 365 admin center. First thing I did here was to check my Admin account under Users \u0026gt; Active users.\nEverything looks correct: Global Administrator role assigned, MFA configured, and the default HalfOnCloud.onmicrosoft.com domain attached to my account.\nOrganization Settings Next stop is Settings \u0026gt; Org settings. This is where you configure tenant-wide options.\nThere are three tabs here: Services, Security \u0026amp; privacy and Organization profile.\nI started with Organization profile to set the basics.\nOrganization Information Under Organization information, you set your technical contact. This is the email address that receives service notifications from Microsoft.\nImportant to set this to someone who actually monitors emails!\nThe sold-to address is pulled from your billing info, so that\u0026rsquo;s already filled in from the purchase (I had to remove mine due to security concerns)\nRelease Preferences This one matters if you want early access to new features. Microsoft offers three options:\nStandard release - Features roll out when Microsoft considers them ready for everyone Targeted release for everyone - Your whole tenant gets features early Targeted release for select users - Only specific users get early features I went with targeted release for select users and added my admin account. This way I can test new features before they hit the rest of the organization. In a production environment, you\u0026rsquo;d add your IT team here.\nData Location Worth checking where Microsoft stores your data. Since I\u0026rsquo;m in Europe, my tenant data sits in European Union/EFTA datacenters for Exchange, Teams \u0026amp; SharePoint.\nNote the \u0026ldquo;Advanced Data Residency\u0026rdquo; section is a paid add-on for stricter data residency controls.\nNot available in all regions and not necessary for most small businesses!\nSecurity and Privacy Settings Switching to the Security \u0026amp; privacy tab.\nThis is where you find password policies, session timeouts, and other security-related tenant settings.\nPassword Expiration Policy Microsoft now recommends setting passwords to never expire which might sound counterintuitive, but the reasoning is solid: forced password changes lead to users picking weaker passwords or just incrementing a number at the end.\nCombined with MFA (which I\u0026rsquo;ve already set up), non-expiring passwords are actually more secure than the old \u0026ldquo;change every 90 days\u0026rdquo; approach.\nIdle Session Timeout I enabled idle session timeout and set it to 12 hours which signs off users out of Microsoft 365 web apps after a period of inactivity.\nThe balance here is security versus convenience, 12 hours means users won\u0026rsquo;t get logged out during a normal workday, but an unattended machine overnight will require re-authentication.\nAdjust this based on your environment, high-security environments might want 1-4 hours, but for a small business 12 hours is reasonable.\nSelf-Service Password Reset SSPR lets users reset their own passwords without calling IT.\nThis is configured in the Entra ID portal, the link takes you directly there.\nNote: I\u0026rsquo;ll cover SSPR setup in a later post when we configure Entra ID settings.\nDomains A quick look at the Domains section, right now I only have the default HalfOnCloud.onmicrosoft.com domain, which Microsoft creates automatically.\nIn a real deployment, you\u0026rsquo;d add your company\u0026rsquo;s custom domain here, this involves adding DNS records to verify ownership.\nAdding a Custom Domain Time to add a real domain, for my tenant I\u0026rsquo;ve acquired a separate new domain called \u0026ldquo;devworkplace.cloud\u0026rdquo;\nUsing the default onmicrosoft.com address works too but it looks unprofessional for an email so I\u0026rsquo;m adding devworkplace.cloud as my custom domain.\nAdd a custom domain you already own and enter your domain name (without www or http)\nDomain Verification Options Microsoft needs to verify you actually own this domain, the recommended method is adding a TXT record to your DNS.\nThere are other options if your registrar doesn\u0026rsquo;t support TXT records, but TXT is the cleanest approach.\nThe TXT Record Details Microsoft gives you the exact values to add. In my case:\nTXT name: @ (or leave blank depending on your registrar) TXT value: MS=ms83647650 TTL: 3600 Copy these values exactly and please note that the MS= code is unique to your tenant!\nAdding the TXT Record at Your Host Provider Now switch to your domain registrar, find the DNS zone editor and add a new TXT record with the values Microsoft provided above.\nSelect your custom domain and Edit the DNS zone:\nHere\u0026rsquo;s what it looks like in domain registrar DNS management:\nType is TXT, name is @, value is the MS= string from Microsoft and TTL is 3600\nDomain Verified - Connection Options Once Microsoft verifies the TXT record, you move to the connection phase. This is where you decide how to set up DNS for Microsoft services.\nI chose \u0026ldquo;Add your own DNS records\u0026rdquo; because I want full control over my DNS configuration.\nThe other option lets Microsoft manage everything, but that means pointing your nameservers to Microsoft which I don\u0026rsquo;t want for a domain that also hosts a website.\nRequired DNS Records for Exchange Here\u0026rsquo;s where it gets detailed, Microsoft lists all the DNS records needed for email to work properly.\nFor Exchange Online, you need the following three records:\nMX record: Routes incoming email to Microsoft CNAME record: autodiscover for email client configuration TXT record: SPF record to prevent email spoofing Adding the MX Record Back in the domain registrar, add an MX record pointing to Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s mail servers.\nThe value is devworkplace-cloud.mail.protection.outlook.com with priority 0 and TTL 3600:\nAdding the Autodiscover CNAME The autodiscover CNAME helps email clients like Outlook automatically find the correct server settings. Name is \u0026ldquo;autodiscover\u0026rdquo;, target is \u0026ldquo;autodiscover.outlook.com\u0026rdquo; and TTL 3600:\nAdding the SPF Record SPF tells receiving mail servers that Microsoft is authorized to send email on behalf of your domain.\nThis is critical for email deliverability, without it your emails might land in spam folders!\nThe value is: \u0026ldquo;v=spf1 include:spf.protection.outlook.com -all\u0026rdquo; and TTL 3600:\nAdvanced Options - Intune and DKIM If you\u0026rsquo;re planning to use Intune for device management (which we are), check \u0026ldquo;Intune and Mobile Device Management for Microsoft 365\u0026rdquo;.\nThis adds two more CNAME records.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve also enabled DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) which adds email signing for better deliverability and security.\nDKIM requires two additional CNAME records.\nIntune CNAME Records For Intune device enrollment to work with your custom domain, add these two CNAME records:\nenterpriseregistration → enterpriseregistration.windows.net enterpriseenrollment → enterpriseenrollment-s.manage.microsoft.com These allow devices to automatically discover your Intune tenant during enrollment.\nDKIM CNAME Records DKIM records are longer and look messy, but they\u0026rsquo;re important. You need two selector records that point to Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s DKIM signing infrastructure.\nThe names are:\nselector1-devworkplace-cloud._domainkey.HalfOnCloud.n-v1.dkim.mail.microsoft\nselector2-devworkplace-cloud._domainkey.HalfOnCloud.n-v1.dkim.mail.microsoft\nNote: The values are unique to your tenant!\nDomain Setup Complete After adding all the DNS records and giving them time to propagate (usually a few minutes, sometimes up to an hour), Microsoft verifies everything and marks the domain as complete.\nFinal Domain Configuration Back in the Domains list, you now see your custom domain alongside the original onmicrosoft.com domain.\nI\u0026rsquo;ve set devworkplace.cloud as the default, which means new users will automatically get email addresses @devworkplace.cloud instead of @HalfOnCloud.onmicrosoft.com.\nBoth domains show as Healthy, which means all DNS records are correctly configured!\nWith the custom domain configured, the tenant is now properly set up for professional use.\nUsers can have email addresses like RaduBogdan@devworkplace.cloud instead of the long onmicrosoft.com addresses.\n","date":"2025-01-09","permalink":"https://halfoncloud.com/posts/m365-business-premium-part-2-configuring-new-tenant/","tags":["MSIntune","M365","Licensing"],"title":"M365 Business Premium Part 2: Configuring the new tenant"},{"categories":["Cloud"],"contents":"Choosing the Right Plan Microsoft offers three main business tiers: Basic, Standard, and Premium. For this blog and my testing environment, I went with \u0026ldquo;Business Premium\u0026rdquo; because it\u0026rsquo;s the only one that includes Intune and Entra ID P1. If you need device management and Conditional Access, the other two won\u0026rsquo;t cut it.\nThe pricing shows $22/user/month for annual billing. I started with monthly to test things out first.\nReal World Pricing in Europe Microsoft publishes prices in USD, but if you\u0026rsquo;re in Europe you pay in local currency plus VAT, the difference is significant.\nI\u0026rsquo;m based in Romania, so here\u0026rsquo;s what the actual costs look like in my region:\nBusiness Premium runs about 29 EUR per user per month with VAT included. That\u0026rsquo;s what I pay for this blog\u0026rsquo;s test tenant. It aligns with typical EU pricing where VAT gets added on top of the base rate.\nE3 is listed at €37.70 per user per month before VAT on Microsoft\u0026rsquo;s Romanian pricing page. Once VAT is applied, you\u0026rsquo;re looking at roughly 45 to 50 EUR per month per user. That\u0026rsquo;s about 1.5 times what Business Premium costs.\nE5 is listed at €59.70 per user per month before VAT. With VAT included, expect around 70 to 75 EUR per user per month. That\u0026rsquo;s roughly 2.5 times the Business Premium price.\nFrom a pure cost perspective: Business Premium at around 29 EUR is competitive and practical for small teams. E3 at 45 to 50 EUR is a meaningful jump that only makes sense if you genuinely need the enterprise management and recovery features. E5 at 70 to 75 EUR is a significant investment that\u0026rsquo;s typically only practical when advanced security automation or compliance tools become necessary.\nA note about \u0026ldquo;Microsoft Teams\u0026rdquo; in the EU: Microsoft previously sold Enterprise plans (E3/E5) without Teams in the EEA due to competition regulations. As of November 2025, customers worldwide can again purchase suites with Teams included. Business plans like Business Premium were not affected and have always included Teams. If you\u0026rsquo;re buying Enterprise plans without Teams, expect to pay about €8 less per user, with Teams available as a separate standalone.\nhttps://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2025/09/12/evolving-our-productivity-offerings-to-resolve-european-competition-concerns-about-teams/\nStarting the Purchase After clicking \u0026ldquo;Buy now\u0026rdquo; on Business Premium, you land on the subscription setup page. Here you pick how many users, subscription length, and billing frequency.\nI chose 1 user and monthly billing. Yes, monthly costs more per month, but I wanted flexibility while setting everything up. You can always switch to annual later once you\u0026rsquo;re committed.\nCreating Your Admin Account This is where you create your first Global Administrator account. The username you pick here will be your primary admin login, and the domain defaults to yourcompany.onmicrosoft.com.\nIn my case: RaduBogdan@HalfOnCloud.onmicrosoft.com\nStore these credentials somewhere safe. This is your \u0026ldquo;break glass\u0026rdquo; account for when things go wrong. Password manager, secure notes, whatever you use. Just don\u0026rsquo;t lose it.\nPayment Details Standard payment form. Credit card, billing address, the usual. Microsoft accepts Visa, Mastercard, and Amex.\nNote that it says \u0026ldquo;You won\u0026rsquo;t be charged until you buy something\u0026rdquo; which confused me at first. They mean the trial period if you selected one, otherwise you get charged immediately after completing the order.\nOrder Review Final confirmation before purchase. Check the price, quantity, payment method, and billing address. The total here showed €29.91 including tax for monthly billing in my region.\nThe fine print mentions you can cancel within 7 days for a prorated refund. After that, no refunds. Also worth noting: Global, Billing, and Reader admin roles will automatically get access to the billing account.\nOrder Confirmed Done. Order is placed and Microsoft immediately asks you to set up MFA. This is not optional anymore, Microsoft enforces it for all new admin accounts.\nThe \u0026ldquo;Action required\u0026rdquo; box tells you to set up Microsoft Authenticator. You can use other authenticator apps, but Microsoft pushes their own.\nSetting Up MFA Microsoft walks you through the Authenticator setup. Download the app if you don\u0026rsquo;t have it, then follow the prompts.\nThe process is straightforward: open the app, add a work account, scan the QR code (not shown here), and approve the test notification.\nMFA Complete Once the authenticator is linked, you\u0026rsquo;re done with the initial security setup. This becomes your default sign-in method going forward.\nWhat\u0026rsquo;s Next At this point you have an active M365 Business Premium subscription and a secured admin account. The next steps would be accessing the admin center, adding a custom domain, and starting to configure the tenant.\nI\u0026rsquo;ll cover those in the next post.\n","date":"2025-01-08","permalink":"https://halfoncloud.com/posts/m365-business-premium-purchase-part-1/","tags":["MSIntune","M365","Licensing"],"title":"M365 Business Premium Part 1: Purchase and Tenant Setup"},{"categories":["Cloud"],"contents":"The Question Everyone Asks When you start looking at Microsoft 365 subscriptions, the licensing matrix feels designed to confuse you. Business Premium, E3, E5, add-ons, standalone plans. Microsoft doesn\u0026rsquo;t make this easy, does it?\nFor a small business with 10 to 20 users, the question is straightforward: do you actually need E3 or E5, or is Business Premium enough?\nAfter working with these plans and testing them in real environments, I can give you a direct answer. For most small businesses, Business Premium is not just enough. It\u0026rsquo;s the right choice.\nWhat Business Premium Actually Gives You Business Premium is not a stripped-down version of the enterprise plans. It\u0026rsquo;s a complete package built specifically for small and medium businesses, with a cap at 300 users.\nIn a single license you get the full Microsoft 365 productivity suite including Exchange Online, Teams, OneDrive, and SharePoint. You get Intune Plan 1 for device management and app deployment. You get Entra ID Premium P1 which means Conditional Access and proper MFA enforcement. You get Defender for Business for endpoint protection with EDR capabilities. And you get Defender for Office 365 Plan 1 for email security.\nThat\u0026rsquo;s not a starter pack. That\u0026rsquo;s a complete security and management platform. The kind of setup that would have required multiple products and significant budget just a few years ago now comes bundled in one SKU.\nIncludes Office apps, email, Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint, etc. Intune Plan 1 basic device management and compliance policies. Entra ID Premium P1 identity and access control (MFA, Conditional Access). Information Protection \u0026amp; Defender for Business endpoint protection and basic threat defense. Focused on SMB security \u0026amp; management with a ~300 users cap. The Security Question This is where people get nervous. They assume Business Premium must have gaps because it costs less than the enterprise plans.\nHere\u0026rsquo;s the reality: Business Premium protects against the threats that actually hit small businesses. Phishing attempts get blocked by MFA and Conditional Access. Malware and ransomware get caught by Defender for Business. Unmanaged devices get blocked by Intune compliance policies. Unauthorized access gets stopped before it starts.\nThe tools are designed to work without a dedicated security team watching dashboards all day. You just need to configure them properly, set your policies and they do their job.\nWhat matters more than the license tier is whether you actually use what you have. An E5 subscription with default settings is less secure than a properly configured Business Premium tenant. I\u0026rsquo;ve seen it happen.\nAs for subscription comparison, I\u0026rsquo;ve used this great site: https://m365maps.com/matrix.htm#000001000001001000000\nWhere Business Premium Stops Business Premium is optimized for control and baseline security. It doesn\u0026rsquo;t try to be everything.\nYou won\u0026rsquo;t get Intune Plan 2 features like Advanced Analytics or Remote Help. There\u0026rsquo;s no Endpoint Privilege Management for removing local admin rights at scale. No Cloud PKI for certificate automation. No Windows Enterprise features like Autopatch or Quick Machine Recovery. And no Security Copilot for AI-assisted threat hunting.\nThese aren\u0026rsquo;t accidental omissions. They\u0026rsquo;re enterprise features designed for environments with hundreds or thousands of devices, dedicated IT teams, and complex compliance requirements. At 10 to 20 users, you probably don\u0026rsquo;t need them yet.\nHow E3 Changed Recently Microsoft quietly upgraded what E3 includes. It\u0026rsquo;s no longer just Office plus compliance tools.\nE3 now includes Intune Plan 2 with Remote Help and Advanced Analytics. It includes Windows Enterprise E3 with Autopatch readiness and better recovery options. The gap between Business Premium and E3 has widened on the management and recovery side.\nE3 makes sense when device count grows, when recovery time becomes critical, and when you need deeper visibility into what\u0026rsquo;s happening across your fleet. It\u0026rsquo;s the step up when scale starts to matter.\nBut here\u0026rsquo;s what catches people off guard: E3 doesn\u0026rsquo;t automatically include the security features many assume it has. Defender for Business is actually a Business Premium thing. With E3, you often need additional security add-ons to match what Business Premium includes out of the box.\nWhat E3 includes:\nAll Office apps, email, Teams, OneDrive, SharePoint and enterprise storage. Intune Plan 1 (same basic Intune as Business Premium). Entra ID Premium P1 same foundational identity as Business Premium. Enterprise features such as larger mailboxes, Windows Enterprise rights, and broader compliance controls. When E5 Actually Makes Sense E5 is not about getting more features. It\u0026rsquo;s about reducing risk in environments where risk is already high.\nYou move to E5 when you\u0026rsquo;re dealing with privileged access sprawl across your organization. When you need certificate lifecycle management at scale. When your security team needs AI-assisted investigation tools. When compliance and audit requirements demand advanced retention and forensic capabilities.\nIf those problems don\u0026rsquo;t sound familiar, E5 is probably overkill. It\u0026rsquo;s powerful, but most of that power sits unused in small business environments.\nWhat E5 includes:\nAll E3 capabilities plus multiple advanced security and compliance tools. Entra ID Premium P2 (advanced identity protection and governance). More advanced Defender services, Cloud App Security, and tools like Insider Risk Management. Power BI Pro, Teams Phone system, and expanded analytics. The Practical Decision For a small business starting fresh today, Business Premium makes the most sense. It delivers modern identity security, proper device management, and solid endpoint protection without unnecessary complexity. You can actually manage it without hiring dedicated security staff.\nYou should consider moving to E3 when your user count pushes past the 300 limit, when enterprise recovery features become important, or when you need the analytics capabilities that come with Intune Plan 2.\nYou should consider E5 when security operations become a full-time job, when compliance requirements demand advanced tooling, or when you\u0026rsquo;re actively dealing with the kind of threats that need investigation capabilities beyond what standard tools provide.\nUntil you hit those points, Business Premium is not a compromise. In my opinion, it\u0026rsquo;s the optimized choice.\nWhy I Started Here For this blog, I deliberately chose Business Premium as my testing ground. Not because it was cheaper, but because it reflects what most real environments actually run.\nEnterprise features are impressive on paper, but they don\u0026rsquo;t teach you how Microsoft 365 management actually works day to day. Business Premium does. The skills and patterns you build here transfer directly to larger environments later.\nThink of it this way: Business Premium teaches you how modern Microsoft cloud management works. E3 shows you how it scales. E5 shows you how it\u0026rsquo;s defended when things go seriously wrong.\nThis progression matches how most IT careers actually develop. Start with the fundamentals, build real experience, then move up when the problems demand it.\n","date":"2025-01-07","permalink":"https://halfoncloud.com/posts/m365-business-premium-purchase-introduction/","tags":["MSIntune","M365","Licensing","EntraID"],"title":"Microsoft 365 Business Premium vs E3 vs E5"},{"categories":["General"],"contents":"Who I Am I\u0026rsquo;m Radu, an IT professional working mostly with Microsoft technologies. My days are spent somewhere between on-prem infrastructure and cloud services, which is exactly where the name \u0026ldquo;HalfOnCloud\u0026rdquo; comes from. Not fully in the cloud, not stuck in the past but somewhere in between, like most real environments.\nMy main areas are Microsoft SCCM/ConfigMgr, Intune, Azure, Entra ID and Microsoft 365. I also work with VMware for virtualization and PowerShell for pretty much everything else. If it can be automated I\u0026rsquo;ll definetely try to.\nWhat This Blog Is This isn\u0026rsquo;t a polished knowledge base or a collection of perfect tutorials. It\u0026rsquo;s more like my technical journal, a place where I document what I learn, what breaks and what actually works in production.\nYou\u0026rsquo;ll find step-by-step guides based on things I\u0026rsquo;ve actually implemented, PowerShell scripts I use in real environments, troubleshooting notes from problems that took way too long to solve and occasional opinions on tools and approaches that I\u0026rsquo;ve tested myself.\nSome posts will be detailed walkthroughs, others might be short notes so I don\u0026rsquo;t forget how I fixed something. My goal here is practical and reproducible, not theoretical.\nWhy I Started Writing Honestly? Because I kept solving the same problems twice. I\u0026rsquo;d fix something, move on, then six months later face the same issue and have to figure it out again. Writing it down forces me to understand it properly and gives me something to reference later.\nIf other people find it useful, that\u0026rsquo;s a bonus. But this blog exists first for future me, and second for anyone else working with these technologies who might be stuck on the same problems.\nThe Journey I don\u0026rsquo;t have all the answers. I\u0026rsquo;m learning as I go, just like everyone else in IT. Some of what I write today might be outdated or improved tomorrow which is totally fine. This blog is a snapshot of where I am in my technical journey, not a claim to expertise.\nIf you spot something wrong or know a better way, I\u0026rsquo;d genuinely like to hear it. The best solutions usually come from the community, not from one person figuring everything out alone.\nThank you for stopping by.\n","date":"2025-01-07","permalink":"https://halfoncloud.com/posts/welcome-to-halfoncloud/","tags":["About"],"title":"Welcome to HalfOnCloud"},{"categories":null,"contents":"Hi, I\u0026rsquo;m Radu IT professional specializing in Microsoft technologies: SCCM, Intune, Azure, EntraID, and M365.
